#### Cash Register Open Source Project


**Description**:  Starting messing with a Flutter App and I needed to make it do something, so
I started with Flutter and Provider.  I didn't want a calculator, so I decided to make a cash
register.  I used an ancient one at my first job at ACME Markets.  It was so "manual", but it
was just as fast as today's modern scanning models.

My goal is to learn Flutter and continue to add features to make this into a real business
application that businesses can use for free.


## Missing Features
1) Set local sales tax rate.
2) Scrollable tape to review charges.
3) Void a line item.
4) Scanning barcodes.
5) Create item descriptions.
6) Calculate change and display best way to make change.


## Getting involved

Also, this is my 1st open source project.  I hope people are interested.
